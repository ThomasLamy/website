    "text": "Summary\nClimate change threatens the long-term sustainability of marine ecosystems. Although Marine protected areas (MPAs) are recognized as an effective tool to protect harvested species and biodiversity, they were not designed to increase the resilience of marine ecosystems to climate change. A major issue that remains to be explored is whether and by what mechanisms current and future MPAs can simultaneously buffer intraspecific (genotypes and phenotypes) diversity and community diversity against climate change, thereby enhancing sustainability of marine ecosystems. In this context, connectivity plays a pivotal role by potentially ensuring that individuals from climate or fishing refugia can repopulate impacted areas. These questions are particularly important in the Western Indian Ocean (WIO), given that warming and fishing exploitation in this region are increasing at an alarming rate. In the WIO, fish support key ecological functions and are the primary source of protein and income for coastal communities, and the creation or expansion of MPAs is a promising mitigation measure for the negative impacts of climate change on fish stocks. To address these issues, this project will focus on the eastern African coastline from Kenya to South Africa and address five key interconnected objectives. (1) First, we will produce high resolution estimates of future changes in environmental conditions and connectivity. (2) Next, we will test whether MPAs harbor individuals of high physiological performance resilient to climate change and identify the genetic origins of these traits. (3) Then, we will test whether MPAs safeguard ecologically important and vulnerable species, and prevent marine ecosystems and associated fisheries from crossing tipping points where climate change will drastically alter their structure. (4) Previous steps will be integrated to assess of how the ecological connectivity of current and potential future MPA networks can enhance resilience to temperature change at the species and community levels of organization. (5) Finally, bi-lateral exchanges with stakeholders in the WIO will be used to quantify their preferences fonr different spatial management options as mitigation for climate change and fishing exploitation. It will be essential for optimizing our recommendations for future management to best achieve long-term sustainability of marine ecosystems faced with climate change.\nOur project will involve 10 funded partners, 5 collaborating partners and at least 21 participants from 5 countries. We will leverage and expand on existing research programs and the extensive expertise of the project partners to produce a large set of results essential to effective management of WIO marine ecosystems. We have already contacted stakeholders and MPA authorities in the study region (e.g., SANParks, Kenya Wildlife Service & MPA wardens in Tanzania & Mozambique) and they are enthusiastic about project objectives. This project addresses the four main questions (2.1 to 2.4) and 9 out of the 13 issues (monitoring, indicators, modeling circulations, multi-level connectivity, iconic and vulnerable species and ecosystems, MPA network, mapping pressures, local perceptions and knowledge, knowledge sharing) laid out in the call for proposals.\nKeywords: climate change, marine spatial planning, larval dispersal, genomics, environmental DNA (eDNA), fish physiology, hydrodynamical models, dispersal models, population models, species distribution models, ecosystem models, monitoring tools, local ecological knowledge, discrete choice experiments."

    "text": "Summary\n\n\n\nsmall dried fishes in Madagascar\n\n\nFish is a critical source of micronutrients essential to human health. Fish consumption can contribute to nutritional security by reducing micronutrient deficiencies that result in a million deaths annually, especially in the poorest countries. However, overfishing threatens fish sustainability and there is a pressing need to understand how we can balance sustainable fisheries and nutritional needs. Madagascar perfectly illustrates this challenge, as many small-scale fisheries are intensive and non-selective with small fishes (&lt;8-12 cm) representing a large fraction of all captures. Yet, those small fishes represent a potentially very important, but poorly understood, sector of the small-scale fishery industry. While a fraction of the small fish captured is kept locally, another one is sun dried and exported towards inland markets. Hence, small dried fishes can travel over long distances and potentially supply poor inland rural areas with critical micronutrients. Given the importance of small dried marine fishes as a unique link between natural ecosystems and human societies, the main goal of this project is to shed light on their diversity and assess whether they can enhance micronutrient supply from coastal to inland areas in Madagascar. We will focus on markets across a 929 km coast-to-inland distance gradient in Madagascar and combine molecular taxonomy, nutritional analysis, and socio-economic surveys to (1) characterize the taxonomic diversity of small dried fishes (2) quantify their micronutrients to investigate how micronutrients transit towards inland areas and (3) conduct socio-economic surveys to evaluate how the valorization of small fishes by fishmen and consumption preferences influence taxonomic and nutritional diversities. By addressing the current defaunation of oceans and its implications for human nutrition, this project aims at filling a critical knowledge gap for anticipating impacts of overfishing on socio-ecological systems\n\n\n\nLéono TODIMAZAVA conducting interviews to assess the diversity and origins of small dried fishes in Antsirabé, Madagascar"

    "text": "Summary\n Understanding herbivory in coral reefs is critical to assessing reef resilience, yet our current knowledge is severely limited due to a lack of high-resolution trophic data. Traditionally, fish species have been grouped into broad functional categories, which oversimplifies complex trophic interactions and masks important ecological differences among species. In coral reef systems, especially, herbivory is a key ecological process that helps prevent algal overgrowth and supports coral recruitment. However, we still know remarkably little about what most tropical herbivorous fishes actually eat and how their diets differ within and among species.\nHerbivorous fish species are believed to partition resources through different mechanisms, such as spatial segregation or targeting distinct sets of algal resources. These processes shape how the herbivory function operates and influence the structure and stability of the herbivore–algae network. For instance, low trophic niche overlap among species can signal high functional complementarity, meaning the herbivory function depends on a diversity of species. In such cases, species loss may lead to critical ecological disruptions. On the other hand, high redundancy in trophic roles could buffer reef systems against biodiversity loss by ensuring functional compensation among species.\nGoal 1 of our project addresses these knowledge gaps by applying a novel, DNA-based approach to reconstruct fine-scale trophic networks. Specifically, we will use DNA metabarcoding of gut contents to determine the way herbivorous fishes achieve herbivory on coral reefs by assessing the extent to which they feed on a similar set of resources or not. We will foucus on the five most abundant herbivore species in Ranobe Bay to build a network of trophic interactions and understand the fine-scale resource partitioning within and among species\nGoal 2 will be to leverage ongoing GPS tracking and participatory catch survey to estimate fishing pressure on herbivorous fishes. Then, our Goal 2 will be to characterize the impact of overfishing on the structure and stability of the algal-herbivore network by combing information on fishing pressure with both detailed information on algal-herbivore trophic interactions (Goal 1) and in situ fish surveys to test if the loss of key trophic interactions can alter herbivory or if the reconfiguration of algal-herbivore networks can maintain herbivory.\nTogether, these objectives will yield critical insights into coral reef resilience, trophic dynamics, and the effects of fishing, with broader implications for sustainable fisheries management and conservation in Madagascar.\n\n\n\nOVERFISH Team working on gut content collection"

    "text": "Summary\nSouthwest Madagascar is experiencing the first climate-induced famine, as prolonged drought is causing agricultural failure. In response, Indigenous agriculturalists are migrating to coasts in search of livelihoods and food, increasing pressure on coral reef resources. The ability of coral reefs to support ~1 billion humans globally is declining due to climate change, overfishing, and pollution. In places such as Bay of Ranobe, Madagascar, other food resources cannot make up food deficits, making reef decline a particularly grave threat to these malnourished populations. Our team is collaborating with Indigenous communities to implement an ecosystem-scale coral reef restoration approach to enhance yields of nutrient-rich marine foods. We are quantifying numerous environmental and human metrics to test the efficacy of this food enhancement approach. Through CEH2 we propose to broaden our scope and: (1) create a decision framework to identify pathways to meet nutritional needs, (2) populate the framework with our traditional scientific data and Indigenous knowledges, (3) continue collecting environmental and human data to identify temporal trends, the efficacy of food system interventions, and the efficacy of our reef restoration approach, (4) model current and future nutrient availability to find food portfolios that buffer against food insecurity in a changing climate, (5) identify the most sensitive indicators of food system changes to create an early warning system and pathways to adapt, (6) enhance climate resilience of coral reefs, the central food source in the region, by increasing offsetting ecological functions, and (7) continue training the next generation of Malagasy scientists. Our team includes expertise across the social and natural sciences, including academia, government, community organizations, and international NGOs. Our commitment to transdisciplinary research, capacity building, and new scalable ways to promote ecological, planetary, and human health with a focus on women will fight climate adversity and empower Indigenous communities.\n\n\n\nSmall-scale fisheries in Madagascar"

    "text": "I am a marine ecologist at the French Research Institute for Sustainable Development (IRD). My interests span community ecology, biodiversity monitoring, ecosystem resilience, marine conservation, small-scale fisheries, and food security, with a focus on integrating ecological and human sciences in coastal environments.\n\n📝 Brief Summary\n\nMy research lies at the intersection of ecology and sustainability, with a focus on the biodiversity, resilience, and conservation of coastal ecosystems.\nI bridge ecological theory and applied conservation to address global challenges such as climate change and biodiversity loss. My work is interdisciplinary, integrating ecological, genetic, and social dimensions to better understand the dynamics of marine ecosystems and their role in supporting coastal communities.\nTo this end, my approach combines long-term ecological monitoring, innovative tools like DNA metabarcoding, and advanced statistical modeling to inform effective conservation strategies.\nI primarily work on tropical coral reefs and temperate kelp forests—two critical ecosystems for both biodiversity and human societies.\nYou can see more about my research on my Research Page.\n\n\n👤 Short Bio\n\n\n\nMy research journey began during my master’s studies, with an early focus on host–parasite interactions at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama. I then turned to marine phylogeography, studying the evolutionary history of European kelp species at the Station Biologique de Roscoff in France.\nDuring my PhD at the University of Montpelier, I investigated the links between population genetics and community ecology using freshwater snails in the French West Indies as a model system. My work focused on species persistence in fragmented, unstable landscapes and the connections between different levels of biodiversity. I combined ecological and genetic approaches to develop one of the most detailed quantitative models of a natural metapopulation, revealing a persistence-competition trade-off that helps explain species coexistence in that system. I also demonstrated how habitat connectivity can drive positive correlations between genetic and species diversity (SGDCs), combining empirical research, theoretical modeling, and meta-analysis.\nAfter completing my Ph.D., I held a postdoctoral position at the Centre for Island Research and Environmental Observatory (CRIOBE) from 2012 to 2013, where I began investigating the resilience and stability of coral reef ecosystems facing multiple and recurrent disturbances. From 2013 to 2015, I continued this line of research at the University of Montréal (Canada), while also expanding my work into evolutionary ecology.\nBetween 2015 and 2021, I was based at the Marine Science Institute at the University of California, Santa Barbara (USA), where I conducted research within two large interdisciplinary programs: the Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON) and the Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) program. My work focused on ecosystem stability through space and time. I developed new statistical frameworks to link ecological stability across spatial scales and organizational levels, combining empirical data, statistical modeling, and meta-analyses. Using long-term spatio-temporal ecological monitoring datasets—primarily from kelp forests, but also from a range of ecosystems within the LTER Network—my work demonstrated how spatial relationships among communities are critical for maintaining ecosystem stability. Finally, I explored new approaches to marine biodiversity monitoring within the SBC LTER abd MBON, focusing on environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding. This work showed that eDNA can effectively capture the diversity of marine fish communities with greater taxonomic resolution and far less field effort than traditional methods.\nSince 2022, I have been a permanent research scientist (CRCN) at the French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development (IRD),\n\n\n🎓 Teaching\nI am a passionate educator with a strong foundation in teaching, earned through the French Agrégation in Life and Earth Sciences. I have taught a wide range of courses—from ecology and evolutionary biology to statistics with R—across universities in France and Canada. My approach combines interactive, research-based learning with a focus on student engagement, mentoring, and real-world application.\n\n\n\n\n Education\n2012\nPh.D. in Evolutionary Ecology\nUniversity of Montpellier, Montpellier, France\nTitle: “From population genetics to community ecology: the case of the freshwater snail metacommunity in the French West Indies”\n2008\nMaster (2nd year) in Oceanography and Marine Ecology\nUniversity Pierre and Marie Curie, Paris, France\n2007\nAgrégation in Life and Earth Sciences (teaching grade)\nEcole Normale Supérieure (ENS), Paris, France\n2006\nMaster (1st year) in Ecology and Evolution\nEcole Normale Supérieure (ENS), Paris, France\n2005\nBachelor of Science in Biology\nUniversity of Nice Sophia-Antipolis, Nice, France\n\n\n📬 Contact\nThomas Lamy\nUMR MARBEC\nUniversité de Montpellier, Place Eugène Bataillon - bâtiment 24 - CC093\n34 095 Montpellier Cedex 5\nEmail: thomas.lamy@ird.fr"
